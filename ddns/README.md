# DDNS

This was an experiment to see how i would make a simple decentralised dns distribution system piggy backed on the CJDNS end to end encrypted networking protocol.  

Everything worked was interesting to see how quick it was, but this code is no use in real life, as there is no protection to stop people spamming the system with new domains and a database such as sqlite with virtual tables would be a better option than a text file.  

Fun experiment!
