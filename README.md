# random-server-stuff
just a collection of random tools.  
Some of or most of these tools are unused now and old!  

### AutoVM

simple automation of vm creation and deletion on KVM  

### DDNS

Poorly implemented experimental decentralised dns system for fun(do not use this code)  

### wp-db

quick script to find and backup wordpress databases, this could be done much better by just backing up the database its self.
was written to be used on a crappy godaddy host for a friend.
