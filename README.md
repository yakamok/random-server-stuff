# random-server-stuff
just a collection of random tools.  
Some of or most of these tools are unused now and old!  

### dns monitor

I use this to see what my deivces are doing on the network.  

### AutoVM

simple automation of vm creation and deletion on KVM  

### DDNS

Poorly implemented experimental decentralised dns system for fun(do not use this code)  

### wp-db

quick script to find and backup wordpress databases, this could be done much better by just backing up the database its self.
was written to be used on a crappy godaddy host for a friend.  

### RSS Feed Check & Stats

This program used to check rss feeds from members of our IRC group and generate stats on how often we posted average word count ...etc, then it would determine if we were lazy or not.  

### WP-post-2-md

Needed to convert the xml export of all posts from wordpress to markdown to use on my new site
