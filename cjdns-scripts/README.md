# Random scripts for cjdns

### hia-data.py

This checks the cjdns process to see what nodes are peered and the checks with the HIA for info on these nodes such as services running and then outputs the data to file.  

### peerstats.py

Uses the data collected from hia-data.py and generates a nice markdown file with the stats.
